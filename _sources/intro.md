# ENGR133 Resources

This is where I will post my demos from class.  There should be interactive demos for both python and MATLAB once this is working.

## How to use this site:

Each module should have working code for the topics being disucssed.
The results of the initial scrips should be available upon opening the page, but you can also interact, modify, and rerun the code.  Select the rocket/play button at the top of the apge, and click "Live Code" to enable this process.
