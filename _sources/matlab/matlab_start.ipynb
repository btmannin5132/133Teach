    "# Getting Started in MATLAB/Octave\n",
    "\n",
    "MATLAB is a computational tool that allows for quick mathematical scripting and plotting.  While Mr. Manning isn't a particular fan of MATLAB (mainly because indexing starts at 1 for almost everything instead of 0 like a normal programing language), even he can't deny the usability and quality plots it creates are very helpful in multiple situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coming from Python, you will see a lot of similarities to MATLAB. Seting up scripts is very similar, and you will see a lot of similarities when setting up loops and functions, though there are minor syntax differences that will take some adjusting to.  If you are already familiar with Python, learning another programming language won't be too tricky for you.  It is just like learning another verbal or written language.  The general rules stay the same, but the nuances and syntax will change slightly, but once you know one language, picking up another tends to move a little smoother.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General scripting in MATLAB\n",
    "\n",
    "MATLAB is a scripting language, meaning that any script you write will essentially be put through a command line in order.  This means that you must define your variables ahead of time prior to using them, just like any other programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can interact with scripts and functions using the `input()` function, which is setup very similar to the `input()` function in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting up variables and arrays in MATLAB\n",
    "\n",
    "MATLAB stands for MATrix LABoratories, so it makes sense that working in matricies are one of the smoothest parts of MATLAB.  Instead of importning `numpy` or `pandas` or any other library, we can setup matricies and variables very smoothly inside of MATLAB."
